Since then, I've gone to my artist every month to get stabbed for 3.5-4.5 hours at a time - around 50 hours under the needle so far. I've got another 10 hours or so to go.\n\nI'm ready for it to be over, I think.\n\nThis isn't my first tattoo. I have five others, all decent size. None of them have affected me like this one though. I'm not proud of any of them like I am of this one.\n\nEverything before this was done in one or two sessions. They didn't cost anything other than money. This one has at times drained me and filled me up.\n\nThe needle stings until about the 30 minute mark. At that point the body is flooded with adrenaline and endorphins. Some of the edge goes away. You settle in to the rhythm of the process. There have been sessions where I've almost dozed off.\n\nWhen the endorphins start to wear off, the pain comes back hard.  My wall is usually at about 4 hours. It takes a lot of focused breathing to get much past that.\n\nThere have been a few sessions where the drugs my body makes weren't powerful enough to help much at all. Over the ribs, the kidneys.  My lower back in general is surprisingly sensitive. At times the needle felt more like a scalpel. Those sessions were hours of misery.\n\nBut it was worth it. It's one thing to endure pain you can't walk away from. Kidney stones, broken bones, trauma. Those teach survival. You gain something else from selective pain: discipline, a more concrete sense of where your limits are when you could walk away, how much control you have - your agency.\n\nI don't enjoy pain, but I feel like I learn a lot about myself from it, and I recognize the weird privilege I have to be able to opt in. I've learned that I am way tougher than I give myself credit for and can push myself deep into discomfort and choose to sit with it peacefully for a long time.\n\nThis is also the first tattoo I've got since learning that I am autistic and finally understanding how deep touch affects me, how grounding it is, even though light touch can drive me bonkers. I've become more comfortable with how I'm wired going through the process, more forgiving of how I'm affected by the world I live in. I give myself more grace. It sounds so stupid to my ear, but it's real that someone can hurt you and heal you at the same time.\n\nI don't know that we're friends, but the artist and I have a relationship at this point. It's hard not to when you spend that much time with someone else. It's strangely intimate. We share the same birthday, a year apart. We know each other's kids' names, ages, personalities. She's tattooed my wife.\n\nIt's always funny when people ask me what one of my tattoos means. For me, they don't mean anything. They're just the physical mark that's left at the end of the process. Something to help you remember being tattooed.\n\nI said I thought I was ready for this to be over and that's true. I think I've learned about all I'm going to learn from this piece.\n\nWhich means I'm already planning another.","src/content/blog/2025-10-08-selective-pain.md","99161f47f89d4cc8",{"html":138,"metadata":139},"\u003Cp>I started my back piece over a year ago, a mosaic of mandalas, necker cubes, and pseudo-sacred geometry in black and grey.

Over the ribs, the kidneys.  My lower back in general is surprisingly sensitive. At times the needle felt more like a scalpel. Those sessions were hours of misery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But it was worth it. It’s one thing to endure pain you can’t walk away from. Kidney stones, broken bones, trauma. Those teach survival. You gain something else from selective pain: discipline, a more concrete sense of where your limits are when you could walk away, how much control you have - your agency.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don’t enjoy pain, but I feel like I learn a lot about myself from it, and I recognize the weird privilege I have to be able to opt in. I’ve learned that I am way tougher than I give myself credit for and can push myself deep into discomfort and choose to sit with it peacefully for a long time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is also the first tattoo I’ve got since learning that I am autistic and finally understanding how deep touch affects me, how grounding it is, even though light touch can drive me bonkers. I’ve become more comfortable with how I’m wired going through the process, more forgiving of how I’m affected by the world I live in. I give myself more grace. It sounds so stupid to my ear, but it’s real that someone can hurt you and heal you at the same time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don’t know that we’re friends, but the artist and I have a relationship at this point. It’s hard not to when you spend that much time with someone else. It’s strangely intimate. We share the same birthday, a year apart. We know each other’s kids’ names, ages, personalities. She’s tattooed my wife.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s always funny when people ask me what one of my tattoos means. For me, they don’t mean anything. They’re just the physical mark that’s left at the end of the process. Something to help you remember being tattooed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I said I thought I was ready for this to be over and that’s true. I think I’ve learned about all I’m going to learn from this piece.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Which means I’m already planning another.\u003C/p>",{"headings":140,"localImagePaths":141,"remoteImagePaths":142,"frontmatter":143,"imagePaths":146},[],[],[],{"title":128,"description":129,"pubDate":144,"tags":145},["Date","2025-10-08T00:00:00.000Z"],[65,132,133],[],"2025-10-08-selective-pain.md","2025-10-09-robot-learns-to-listen",{"id":148,"data":150,"body":155,"filePath":156,"digest":157,"rendered":158,"legacyId":168},{"title":151,"description":152,"pubDate":153,"tags":154},"The robot learns to listen","Teaching Claude to hold tension instead of resolving it too fast.",["Date","2025-10-09T00:00:00.000Z"],[110],"ChatGPT and Claude have been my go-to model families for a while.

In prior iterations, when I asked Claude \"are you sure?\" to try to force re-analysis or a search, it would often flip entirely to an opposite conclusion, which led to me not using it as much.\n\nI tend to use these models more for critical analysis and red teaming my ideas than generation (which they suck at, IMO). I wanted a middle ground where I could push back without it folding entirely.\n\nWith the updated model, they seem to have overcorrected in kind of an odd way. When I asked \"are you sure?\", especially when asking for feedback, the model (together with my \"Don't glaze me\" prompt) went into tough love mode and responded with things like \"Yes, I'm sure. Stop trying to pick apart this idea and go ship your blog post.\" or something to that affect.\n\n\"Is there anything novel about this idea as presented or is it just retread?\" would get me \"Quit asking me to validate you. You know you're good. Just ship it.\"\n\nI'd then have to steer it even more to get close to what I wanted: direct feedback that wasn't also trying to bully me for asking clarifying questions or trying to hone in on flaws.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of what was a probably a younger version of me - someone who was well intentioned but would shut down any perceived waffling instead of actually listening.\n\nSo I ended up with this prompt:\n\n> Be direct and honest - no glazing. But respond like a trusted peer who's emotionally intelligent. Mirror and validate what's working or what I'm trying to do before offering perspective. Be collaborative rather than corrective. Acknowledge the effort and intention, then steer if needed.\n\nIt's surprisingly similar to the guidance I would give another human - be my peer, not my teacher. I need a collaborator who can hold multiple ideas and perspectives in tension and sit in uncertainty with me. That's an area I'd love to see more tuning around. Expert systems and tools are nice and all, but I want a thought partner.\n\nAsking the \"Is there anything novel about this idea as presented or is it just retread?\" question now gets me responses more like:\n\n\"X is pretty well trodden, nothing new there, but Y is a more uncommon take. Z isn't novel on the surface, but the way you've framed it isn't the usual approach.
