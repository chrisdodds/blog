I've tried others, they're not as good. For the last several months, I've mostly used Claude for coding/dev work and ChatGPT for everything else: documentation, analysis, etc.\n\nI've tried using GPT for coding a few times and am not impressed. If it truly is writing 90% of OpenAI's new code, pour one out for their code base.\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model I've used and is generally more pleasant to use than prior versions. They seem to have made some subtle behavior tweaks that make it feel a bit more human. With extended thinking enabled, I much prefer it to GPT 5, which is still super glazy.\n\nI encountered an odd pattern with it that needed some assistant prompt tweaking to correct. In prior iterations, when I asked Claude \"are you sure?\" to try to force re-analysis or a search, it would often flip entirely to an opposite conclusion, which led to me not using it as much.\n\nI tend to use these models more for critical analysis and red teaming my ideas than generation (which they suck at, IMO). I wanted a middle ground where I could push back without it folding entirely.\n\nWith the updated model, they seem to have overcorrected in kind of an odd way. When I asked \"are you sure?\", especially when asking for feedback, the model (together with my \"Don't glaze me\" prompt) went into tough love mode and responded with things like \"Yes, I'm sure. Stop trying to pick apart this idea and go ship your blog post.\" or something to that affect.\n\n\"Is there anything novel about this idea as presented or is it just retread?\" would get me \"Quit asking me to validate you. You know you're good.

For the last several months, I’ve mostly used Claude for coding/dev work and ChatGPT for everything else: documentation, analysis, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve tried using GPT for coding a few times and am not impressed. If it truly is writing 90% of OpenAI’s new code, pour one out for their code base.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model I’ve used and is generally more pleasant to use than prior versions. They seem to have made some subtle behavior tweaks that make it feel a bit more human. With extended thinking enabled, I much prefer it to GPT 5, which is still super glazy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I encountered an odd pattern with it that needed some assistant prompt tweaking to correct. In prior iterations, when I asked Claude “are you sure?” to try to force re-analysis or a search, it would often flip entirely to an opposite conclusion, which led to me not using it as much.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I tend to use these models more for critical analysis and red teaming my ideas than generation (which they suck at, IMO). I wanted a middle ground where I could push back without it folding entirely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the updated model, they seem to have overcorrected in kind of an odd way. When I asked “are you sure?”, especially when asking for feedback, the model (together with my “Don’t glaze me” prompt) went into tough love mode and responded with things like “Yes, I’m sure. Stop trying to pick apart this idea and go ship your blog post.” or something to that affect.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Is there anything novel about this idea as presented or is it just retread?” would get me “Quit asking me to validate you.
