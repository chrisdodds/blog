[I wrote a while back about the back piece I've been working on](/blog/2025-10-08-selective-pain/). I was ready to be finished at the time, and wasn't learning anything more from the discomfort. That held true.

It's done now, minus the final round of healing. August 2024 to February 2026. Sixty-something hours sitting. The last eight were a slog going over scar tissue and the thin skin of my lower spine. Ladies who get mastectomy cover ups must be made of much stronger stuff than me. I earned this ink though. The little voice in my head that undercuts compliments and warns me I'm flying too close to the sun can't win this one.

Progression, from first session to last (missing a couple of pics I can't find at the moment):

It'll settle down a bit once it's healed. I have a small, silly piece scheduled next month, but nothing more on the books after that. My left arm is probably next though--thinking geometric + organic (leaves, fronds, something like that). We'll see.
