Remember that [exciting thing I couldn't discuss](/blog/2026-01-26-publishing-updates)? It's official: my novella won the 2026 [Miami University Press Novella Prize](https://sites.miamioh.edu/miami-university-press/).

I did a thing!

I'll share more details as they emerge - cover, release date, all that. For now: this is real, it's happening, and I'm equal parts thrilled and terrified about people actually reading this thing.

Big thanks to the Miami University Press crew for picking up my odd creature and giving it a home.

More soon. Lots to learn.
