I’m not sure why we’re in Bangalore. Put some faces to the names we see in emails? Knowledge sharing? None of the answers stick. None of them feel real. I’ve never been, so I don’t push back.

The office accepts us, we meet, we look at diagrams, we eat strange interpretations of American food at the Marriott, where a pulled-pork BBQ sandwich is actually a Sloppy Joe. Breakfast is every fruit known to man.

The coworker who came with me disappears a few days in and I don’t see him for the rest of the trip. Trapped in his hotel bathroom. Must have drunk the water. I’m sure he’s fine. Probably. People ask about him. I shrug.

I’m on my own until the freshers—new hires—adopt me. If it occurs to them that my pointless visit for a week costs more than they make in a year, they are oddly good natured about it. I don’t think I would be.

A couple of them take me shopping, although I don’t know what to buy. They seem surprised that I know a tandoor is for making bread, and that I’ve picked up that kurti and kurta are the gendered words for shirt. Meanwhile, they speak three languages apiece, but mostly want to talk about Marvel movies.

I buy two brass Hindu icons and a sari for my wife. I don’t know if I’m supposed to. My new friends just shrug and take me to a tailor to get the sari lined with what looks like another sari. They don’t warn me about the mirrors on the auto-rickshaws that bruise my shoulders, but do direct the Ola driver to take me straight back to my hotel and not on the great circle he had planned to gouge me with.

The local manager invites me to come on a team field trip to celebrate… something.

On the drive there, the driver tells a story about being stopped in Houston for honking his horn too much. Cop says, “Someone is going to shoot you.” Everyone laughs. He uses the horn like he’s playing Galaga.

I disassociate for the rest of the ride to cope with being a passenger in Indian traffic.

The venue is half cricket field, half water park. Someone was supposed to bring me a spare set of swim trunks but forgot. “It’s OK. You can rent them.”

I have never heard the word “rent” associated with swim trunks before. You cannot, in fact, rent swim trunks at the water park, but you can buy the world’s skimpiest male Speedo for $2.

Ten minutes later, I’m a white-as-bone, tattooed buoy in a wave pool of strangers who are delighted that I can float.

“How are you doing that?”

I tell them I’m American, which they accept as a reasonable answer.
