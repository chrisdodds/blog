My publishing "system" is picking up steam. First, let's revisit [November](/blog/2025-11-05-more-adventures-in-publishing):

> * 7 pieces: 1 novella, 3 short creative nonfiction essays, 3 short stories
> * 36 total submissions
> * 14 rejections
> * 2 of those were personalized, the rest were form.
> * 1 of the rejects made it to the second round

Has turned into:

* 12 pieces: 1 novella, 3 short creative nonfiction essays, 8 short stories
* 80 total submissions
* 43 rejections
* 6 personalized rejections
* 1 short list
* 1 long list
* 1 acceptance
* 1 thing I can't talk about yet, but is very exciting.

"This Did Not Matter" didn't make the [short list for Fractured Lit's Elsewhere Prize](/blog/2025-12-01-longlisted-fractured-lit-elsewhere), which was a bummer, but expected. I'm shopping it to some more horror/dark-fantasy-focused venues.

The acceptance listed above is one of my weirder pieces - about dissociation and giving up agency. Also a little spicy. It got picked up by [BULL](https://mrbullbull.com/newbull/). I'll link to it once it's live. It got a very binary reaction on CritiqueCircle, which probably means it's good. :D

The exciting thing which cannot be discussed yet was a big surprise. Soon, my precious. Soon.

Regarding the end-to-end process, I'm finding that:

* I'm gravitating to a form that's more than flash, less than short story (1000-2000 words). Some places call it short-short, but most call it flash. Whatever.

* My general familiarity with mags/journals is maturing and I've developed a better sense of fit based on editorial theme. Fewer wasted shots.

* This is pretty fun. Even if some parts are a slog.
