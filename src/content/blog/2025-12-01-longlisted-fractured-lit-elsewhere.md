The [public announcement](https://fracturedlit.com/fractured-lit-2025-elsewhere-prize-judged-by-jemimah-wei-longlist/) is up. I can talk about it now. One of my fiction pieces, "This Did Not Matter," has been longlisted for Fractured Lit's Elsewhere prize.

Visible traction. Huzzah!

I should find out in the next week or two if I make the shortlist and/or win. I'm honestly happy with just being longlisted. The piece is more accessible than most of my writing, but lacks the human-focus and interiority of past winners, so it's probably at the edge of their taste-band. It's cold mythic dread, kinda McCarthic. An exhausted djinn destroys the last inhabitants of a dying desert town, then seeks its own end. Rainbows and unicorns...

We'll see what happens. I'll share it when I can.
